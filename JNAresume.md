### Summary of Experience

An alumna of the Western Washington University Master of Arts archives program, I completed internships at the National Archives and Records Administration, Yellowstone National Park, and the Densho cultural history project in Seattle, WA. In 2013, I became an archives and records specialist for King County, providing first-line reference consultation and performing archival work along the entire records lifecycle for Road Services Division records - especially indexing and describing records using an extensive database and multiple indexes, maintaining quality control over description, and helping to create indexing standards through a controlled vocabulary. Upon the sudden departure of our technical lead, I became the go-to problem solver to fix glitches in the Microsoft Access database that manages our collections and in the JavaScript that updates our online repository. This experience, as well as my adventures in learning Python, accustomed me to steep learning curves and taught me the perseverence to push through the valley of error messages to reach the promised land of beautiful, perfectly-functioning code.  

- Graduated summa cum laude as an undergraduate 
- Pursued classes in digital forensics and programming independently and post-graduation  
- Seeks opportunities to combine critical thinking and creativity with well-constructed, elegant code to solve problems   
- Self-motivated and detail-oriented optimist who sees obstacles as opportunities for growth and learning
- Wide-ranging technological experience with various operating systems and software, including  
    - basic Python and JavaScript;  
    - Encoded Archival Description (EAD), an XML standard that encourages open, linked archival finding aids;  
    - Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), a controlled vocabulary of subjects for use in standardized archival description;  
    - Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC), the early form of encoding used by libraries; and   
    - Dublin Core, a metadata standard used by archives, libraries, and museums to describe resources.

### Professional Experience



#### Records Management Specialist  
#### King County Road Services Map and Records Center
##### Apr 2013 - present


As the primary records coordinator for the Road Services Division, I process and manage the entire records lifecycle for the office of the County Road Engineer. I also provide first-line reference services in a public-facing capacity, using multiple databases and repositories to answer internal and external questions relating to the surveying, establishment, engineering and construction, maintenance, and improvement of County roads; one such repository is our unit’s [online Map Vault](http://www.kingcounty.gov/mapvault "Search for maps"), with 270,000 images and counting. Three performance evaluations of “Outstanding” in two years have resulted in a step increase, term extension, and a career-service position with progressive responsibility.

* Provide friendly, comprehensive customer service to increase records engagement internally, while tracking, gathering, and reporting customer service data to management to help direct the unit’s work program  
* Create metadata for existing and newly-accessioned records; correcting errors and obsolete information to accurately represent series; use NetBeans to synch digitized images with repository  
* Digitize responsive records according to established standards as part of reference  
* Act as a subject matter expert, advising on internal records procedures as well as connecting reference needs to other repositories and information sources to provide complete records services  
    * In this capacity, I have become a resource for other staff members and help guide work practices, including in submitting digitized images into Bizarro iDocs, our online repository  
* Created step-by-step guides to facilitate records submission and processes  
* Maintain quality control over descriptive metadata in an extensive Access database and use the database to maintain chain of custody information for retrieval and transparency  
* Liaise with the engineering, traffic, and administrative units, managing the accession, ingest, and transfer of 800 boxes of records during a division move, maintaining description, tracking, and legal, regulatory, and reference access to records in an electronic accessioning and indexing system  
* Generate cost estimates, prepare reports, and give presentations in interdepartmental meetings to support management’s goals and work program  
* Manage transmittals and supporting paperwork, administer disposition waiting periods and legal holds, and coordinate with vendors for transfer or disposition  
* Mapped unit's workflow to better describe archival processes to management and to improve efficiency
* Supervised and trained new hires during project planning and a major relocation of the workgroup  
* Successfully made the case for relinquishing two obsolete records storage machines in favor of accessioning the contents into our database system, making the records searchable and more accessible, while saving King County $12,000 in moving costs and reducing unnecessary complexity in our division’s recordkeeping processes  



#### Intern
#### [Densho: The Japanese American Legacy Project](http://www.densho.org)
##### Mar 2013 - Apr 2013

Helping to sustain such an important cultural project was personally fulfilling, and the experience I gained in creating metadata according to a controlled vocabulary and cataloging scanned images of very personal documents and photographs intensified my belief in quality digitizing, accurate cataloging, and increased accessibility of images as critical to community, commemoration, and cultural knowledge.

* Digitally processed and cleaned up thousands of scanned images of journal pages written in Japanese between the 1930s and the 1970s  
* Cataloged documents, diaries, and family photo album images for addition to Densho’s online repository, attributing appropriate metadata according to a controlled vocabulary  



#### Archives Aide - Student Employee
#### National Archives and Records Administration
##### Jun 2012 - Mar 2013

Thrilled to return to NARA as an Archives Aide, I gained valuable preservation and description experience while supporting career service staff in reference services and meeting processing goals. I actively sought additional projects from updating finding aids to staffing the reference desk, maintaining a secure, accessible environment for archival research. My duties allowed me to become knowledgeable about several Federal record groups, as well as to spread my love of history and research through small outreach opportunities.  

* Assisted with reference services and helped create exhibits  
* Maintained a database of and performed item-level preservation work on over 8100 photographic negatives of the Department of Energy’s DuPont Collection of the Manhattan Project’s Hanford Engineering Works, 1943-1946  
* Maintained a database of over 400 drawings for the Army Corps of Engineers, updating location and condition information while humidifying, flattening, and re-housing each drawing, totaling over 2300 cu. ft.  
  


#### Archives Technician
#### Yellowstone National Park
##### Oct 2012 - Dec 2012

Seizing the opportunity to complete an internship within sight of the Roosevelt Arch, I supported the mission of the Research Center by performing both face-to-face and distance reference services, providing digital scans of historically meaningful records such as letters written by Theodore Roosevelt, and integrating processing and online outreach using photographs of the destruction by fire of the Canyon Hotel.

* Arranged and described the John Burger Photographs collection, using re:Discovery ICMS to generate a finding aid [available on through the National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/historyculture/upload/john_burger_photographs.pdf)  
* Processed 84 linear feet of the Park Facilities series  
* To generate interest and publicity, wrote blog posts on the Canyon Hotel, [Cuthbert the National Park Pup](http://www.nps.gov/yell/blogs/Cuthbert-the-National-Park-Pup.htm), and noteworthy park correspondence  
* Assisted researchers in the reading room and via email to answer questions ranging from the historical to the geological  



#### Graduate Assistant

#### Intern/Volunteer
#### National Archives and Records Administration
##### Mar 2011 - Aug 2011

As a first-year MA candidate and through firm belief in the power of public archives, I volunteered at the National Archives and Records Administration, working either individually or as part of a team to break through processing goals and make more records accessible to researchers. I gained knowledge about series as diverse as court exhibits (RG 21), Forest Service records (RG 95), and education records from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (RG 75).

During my time as an intern at NARA, I also successfully lobbied for greater social media outreach to engage potential users of a new generation and to publicize new or newly-processed collections.

* Appraised an accession of postmaster scrapbooks of newspaper clippings from Seattle and Washington state, dating to the early 20th century  
* Processed the records of and wrote finding aids for:  
    * The records of the Malheur and Colville National Forests  
    * 180 cu. ft. of court exhibits (documents, architectural drawings, and artifacts) from the Western District Court of Washington in Tacoma, dating from the 1880s to the 1960s, as part of a team    
    * Records of the Colville Indian Agency Education Supervisor  
* Created social media posts to promote interesting finds in the stacks and helped with lobby displays
