### Essay Answers

**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**  
>My first experience with writing code was in high school when I built a Geocities page dedicated to the Australian pop duo Savage Garden. To my parentsâ€™ chagrin, I stayed up late most nights learning HTML whenever I saw some feature somewhere else that I really liked or found a new tutorial. Mine had all the classy bells and whistles, like an obnoxious MIDI file - of a Savage Garden track, of course - that played automatically as soon as the page loaded.  

>As an adult, my interesting in programming reawakened while pursuing my degree in archival science. Since those late nights when I had mainly used my burgeoning knowledge to create a worship site for a pop band and a scrolling marquee header was still considered cool in some circles, things had changed in other, more important ways (more on this in question 2). Yet I found that I was still intensely satisfied when I wrote encoded description that was neat, elegant, and organized. After completing my degree in May 2013, I enrolled in digital archives workshops that focused on retrieving information at the bitstream level, and I have pursued programming experience on Coursera and Codecademy.  

**2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?**  
>If accepted into the Ada program, I am fully committed to the difficult yet rewarding path that choice entails - mentally, emotionally, and financially. This has been a long-term consideration for me, and I have the full support of my significant other and our families. In two years, I hope to be gainfully employed as a junior developer at a start-up or other company here in Seattle, learning from more experienced engineers about design, project planning, data management, and quality assurance implementation.  

>With my background in archival research and outreach, I expect that there will be new opportunities in the next five years to merge full stack or front end development with historical and cultural applications to make archival collections more accessible to more people in more places. [Historypin](http://www.historypin.org), [Ancestry](http://www.ancestry.com), and [the New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/collections/labs) have already created portals and apps to make this possible, and there are indexing and genetic data analysis needs that are begging for investment from developers. My plan is to be ready for these opportunities if they arise, while building my skills in one of the many tech-based companies that have already been successful in the Seattle area.  

**3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you leared a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**  
**4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.**
