### Essay Answers

**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**  
>My first experience with writing code was in high school when I built a Geocities page dedicated to my favorite band at the time. To my parents’ chagrin, I stayed up late learning HTML whenever I saw some feature somewhere else that I really liked.

As an adult, my interesting in programming reawakened while pursuing my degree in archival science. Since those late nights when I had mainly used my burgeoning knowledge to create a worship site for a pop duo and a scrolling marquee header was still considered cool in some circles, software- and web-based approaches have revolutionized access to information and the analysis of it. And I found that same satisfaction of my Geocities days when I wrote encoded description that was neat, elegant, and organized. After completing my degree in May 2013, I enrolled in digital archives workshops that focused on retrieving information at the bitstream level, and I have pursued programming experience online. This has changed the way I think about what’s possible - now I approach a problem by wondering what I could write that would solve it, instead of needing an existing program made by someone else.  

**2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?**  
>If accepted into the Ada program, I am fully committed to the difficult yet rewarding path that choice entails - mentally, emotionally, and financially. This has been a long-term consideration for me, and I have the full support of my significant other and our families. In two years, I hope to be gainfully employed as a junior developer at a start-up or other company here in Seattle, learning from more experienced engineers about design, project planning, data management, and quality assurance implementation.  

>Considering the explosion in online access to information in the last decade, I expect that there will be new opportunities in the next five years to merge full stack or front end development with historical and cultural applications to make archival collections more accessible to more people in more places. [Historypin](http://www.historypin.org), [Ancestry](http://www.ancestry.com), and [the New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/collections/labs) have already created portals and apps to make this possible, and there are indexing and genetic data analysis needs that are begging for investment from developers. My plan is to be ready for these opportunities if they arise, while building my skills in one of the many tech-based companies that have already been successful in the Seattle area.  

**3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you leared a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**  
>My first attempt at college was in 1999, the fall after I graduated from high school, but I was unfocused and hadn’t thought concretely about what I expected from my life. Consequently, I bailed on classes that were too boring, and I did poorly in upper-level classes that were too advanced. Seven years passed while I worked low-wage skilled jobs and supported myself. When I finally returned to pursue a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in history with an eye toward graduate school, I was motivated, focused, and energized. I was ready to go.

>Just before registration, the university informed me that, because of my earlier poor grades, I would be ineligible for financial aid - and therefore unable to afford tuition. My initial reaction was tearful panic. This was the moment that I became my mother’s daughter, taking a breath and reassessing. I appealed and explained why I was ready to be a student again - and I was admitted under probation. Four years later, I graduated *summa cum laude*. In the years since, I have learned that a rejection is rarely final and that, while there are things I cannot control, there are infinite possibilities in those I can.

**4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.**  
>I am insatiably curious as well as a prodigious reader, and I learn best by doing and asking questions. When I first learned HTML as a teen, I read through a quick introductory tutorial while building my page, then hunted through the source code of other pages when I saw things that I liked.  

>As an adult, I place more value on structured learning (and also know that citing others’ ideas in your work, just as in a thesis, is non-negotiable!). Since my archives program focused on paper records, I have since designed a plan of online self-directed learning, using Coursera and Codecademy and assessing needed skills based on desirable job descriptions and conversations with colleagues. To that end, my current goals are mastery in Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.  

>My main obstacle is that interaction in this sphere is essentially limited to forum discussions, with zero face-to-face learning or team building, experiences that were beneficial and inspiring during my bricks-and-mortar educational experience. Lastly, online study has not yet resulted in real-world examples around which to test my own emergent ideas, which I hope to rectify by joining the Ada program.
