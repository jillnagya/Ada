### Essay Answers

**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**  
>My first experience with writing code was in high school when I built a Geocities page dedicated to the Australian pop duo Savage Garden. To my parentsâ€™ chagrin, I stayed up late most nights learning HTML whenever I saw some feature somewhere else that I really liked or found a new tutorial. Mine had all the classy bells and whistles, like an obnoxious MIDI file - of a Savage Garden track, of course - that played automatically as soon as the page loaded.  

>As an adult, my interesting in programming reawakened while pursuing my degree in archival science. Since those late nights when I had mainly used my burgeoning knowledge to create a worship site for a pop band and a scrolling marquee header was still considered cool in some circles, things had changed in other, more important ways (more on this in question 2). Yet I found that I was still intensely satisfied when I wrote encoded description that was neat, elegant, and organized. After completing my degree in May 2013, I enrolled in digital archives workshops that focused on retrieving information at the bitstream level, and I have pursued programming experience on Coursera and Codecademy.  
**2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?**  
**3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you leared a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**  
**4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.**
